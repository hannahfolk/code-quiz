## Process
    
I started out by writing the HTML and adding CSS styling to it, then commenting out the HTML, and adding elements via Javascript, while following along with my commented-out HTML. Then I went under a long-winded process of trying to figure out how to load each page individually in a for loop. I would change the text content for each individual element. That wasn't working so I decided to forgo the dryness of it and just write out everything individually. Local storage was also not working.

Then after getting some help, I decided to put them in pages and instead change the opacity of the different pages as they cycle through. This cleaned up my code a lot, and I was also able to easily write things into the local storage.
