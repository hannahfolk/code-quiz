Hannah Folk Code Quiz
=======

## Description

This is my code quiz, created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

## Process

I started out by writing the HTML and adding CSS styling to it, then commenting out the HTML, and adding elements via Javascript, while following along with my commented-out HTML.

## Credits

I used www.w3schools.com for help with Math.random(), addEventListener(), and array methods. I also used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Fisher_and_Yates'_original_method for figuring out how to shuffle my array in the final moments of the application.
